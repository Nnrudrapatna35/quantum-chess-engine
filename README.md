Quantum Final Project

In this project, the team created a hybrid classical-quantum engine which can find the queen moves which result in checkmate (in the case of a 4x4 reduced chessboard, with mate in one puzzles). The primary quantum computing aspect of the project involves an implementation of Grover's Algorithm with at most 16 qubits. The algorithm was used to determine all possible permutations of the black king and white king for which the black king would be in checkmate given a specific queen positioning.
